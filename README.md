# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis-by-Power-BI
I have been asked to share an exploratory analysis over Marketing Campaign Dataset!!!   Actionable Insight:  ðŸ•¯If we have to increase profit, it directly correlates with spending  amount.    if we decreases spending  amount then profit will increase and vice versa. As Spending amount is inversely proportional to Profit.
